# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover the correllation of key performance indicators in schools such as reading and math scores with spending, school size, and type of school.  In order to do this a district summary dataframe and school summary dataframe were created to uncover the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools based on average math and reading scores.  This project also included the impact of having to remove the ninth-grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School and analyzing the impact it had on the overall performance of the school in relation to other schools.  

The project consisted of having to read raw data from csv files, clean and inspect data (and correct inappropriate data), merge data sets to create a new dataframe to gather more information, perform calculations for key metrics, and visualize data with tables.


## Results




## Summary
The overall conclusion saw that there was a greater correlation to school size to performance rather than spending.  Smaller schools outperformed school with larger populations regardless of the amount that was spent per student.
